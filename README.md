# Stealth: Code of the Unseen

In shadows shrouded, where silence reigns,  
Stealth emerges, the art it sustains.  
Whispers of darkness, a ghostly embrace,  
Unseen, unheard, leaving no trace.

A phantom in motion, with grace it glides,  
Through labyrinthine paths, where danger resides.  
Mastery of silence, a skill honed to perfection,  
Invisible steps, a covert reflection.

🔍 Eyes sharp and vigilant, attuned to the night,  
Like a predator stalking, hidden from sight.  
Whispering wind becomes its ally,  
As it navigates danger, undeterred, sly.

A shadow dancer, elusive and quick,  
Moving like smoke, agile and slick.  
🌀 Vanishing in moments, slipping away,  
Leaving behind only echoes of its play.

Minds puzzled, baffled, by its elusive feat,  
Invisible guardian, a foe hard to defeat.  
🎯 With calculated precision, it strikes unseen,  
A whisper, a touch, a phantom, serene.

Stealth, a silent symphony in the dark,  
Unseen conductor, leaving its mark.  
Mysterious and enigmatic, forever unknown,  
The art of stealth, forever shall it be shown.
