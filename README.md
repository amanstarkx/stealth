# Stealth.js: Code of the Unseen

```javascript
const Stealth = {
  initiate: () => {
    let shadows = true;
    let silence = true;

    while (shadows && silence) {
      // Whispers of darkness, a ghostly embrace
      // Unseen, unheard, leaving no trace

      // A phantom in motion, with grace it glides
      // Through labyrinthine paths, where danger resides

      // Mastery of silence, a skill honed to perfection
      // Invisible steps, a covert reflection

      // Eyes sharp and vigilant, attuned to the night
      // Like a predator stalking, hidden from sight

      // Whispering wind becomes its ally
      // As it navigates danger, undeterred, sly

      // A shadow dancer, elusive and quick
      // Moving like smoke, agile and slick

      // Vanishing in moments, slipping away
      // Leaving behind only echoes of its play

      // Minds puzzled, baffled, by its elusive feat
      // Invisible guardian, a foe hard to defeat

      // With calculated precision, it strikes unseen
      // A whisper, a touch, a phantom, serene
    }
  }
};

Stealth.initiate();
```
